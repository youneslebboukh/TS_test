            "Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is also known as cold laser therapy or photobiomodulation therapy. LLLT utilizes visible light and infrared laser beams in the range of 450–1000 nm. Single wavelength or monochromatic light is emitted from a low-intensity laser diode (<500 mW). The light source is placed in contact with the skin, allowing the photon energy to penetrate tissue, where it interacts with various intracellular biomolecules to restore normal cell function and enhance the body’s healing processes [1]. This contrasts with the thermal effects produced by the high-power lasers that are used in cosmetic and surgical procedures to destroy tissue [1], as mentioned in the PubMed Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) subheading for LLLT.\n",
            "LLLT effects are not due to heat but rather to a photochemical reaction that occurs when a photoacceptor molecule within the cell absorbs a photon of light, becomes activated, and changes the cell’s membrane permeability and metabolism. Presently, cytochrome c oxidase, opsins and their associated calcium channels, and water molecules have been identified as the main mediators of the photochemical mechanisms [2]. This leads to increased mRNA synthesis and cell proliferation. LLLT produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in normal cells, but ROS levels are lowered when it is used in oxidatively stressed cells, like in animal models of disease. LLLT up-regulates antioxidant defenses and decreases oxidative stress [2].\n",
            "Low-level lasers are a safe, noninvasive technology approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada for several chronic and degenerative conditions, temporary pain relief, cellulite treatment, body contouring, lymphedema reduction, hair growth, and chronic musculoskeletal injuries. LLLT increases microcirculation, lymphatic drainage, and cellular metabolism, thereby relieving many acute and chronic conditions.\n",
            "The MeSH database in PubMed contains more than 7000 articles on LLLT. The effects of LLLT have been confirmed through several meta--analysis studies and include anti-inflammatory [3] and analgesic effects [4], tissue healing [5], treating tendinopathy [6], and improving lymphedema [7]. Recent lab and animal studies suggest LLLT is ready for clinical trials over myocardial infarction [5]. In 2010, a meta-analysis concluded that there was strong evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect of LLLT [3].\n",
            "To date, published reports indicate that LLLT up-regulates antioxidant defenses and decreases ROS in oxidatively stressed cells and animal models of disease. The anti-inflammatory effect of LLLT directly addresses the main pathology of disorders such as musculoskeletal, lungs, wounds, brain, trauma, etc. LLLT reduces NF-kB, a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, in pathological conditions. Reports have shown reductions in reactive nitrogen species and prostaglandins in various animal models [2].\n",
            "LLLT has diverse effects [8]:\n",
            "LLLT has been used in respiratory tract diseases since 1978. Empirical practice on over 1000 patients produced data pertaining to chronic pneumonia, acute pneumonia, asthma, and chronic bronchitis in children, adults, and elderly. Common findings include reduced chest pain and heaviness; normalization of respiratory function; improved blood, immunological, and radiological parameters; and shortened recovery times. In community-acquired pneumonia, intravenous LLLT of blood added to conventional treatment significantly promoted the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. In asthma, the addition of LLLT was more effective than medical treatment alone and it shortened the duration of treatment and recovered bronchial sensitivity to sympathomimetics [9–11]. In newborns with pneumonia, LLLT combined with conventional medical regimens optimized the treatment infectious and inflammatory diseases, reduced the incidence of complications, and shortened recovery periods [12].\n",
            "LLLT is a well-known treatment modality in veterinary medicine. Upper and lower respiratory conditions in dogs and cats are common, and viral and bacterial infections are often highly contagious. Regardless of etiology, inflammation is the major pathology of these conditions. The addition of LLLT to conventional treatment alleviates symptoms and stimulates the healing process in tissues. General guidelines for the use of laser therapy in animals and protocols for specific conditions are published [13].\n",
            "Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that affect animals. In humans, they produce diseases such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been named COVID-19 and the clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to death [14].\n",
            "Respiratory viruses infect either the upper or lower airways. Typical upper-respiratory infections are milder, more contagious, and spread easily, whereas lower-respiratory infections spread much less frequently but are more severe and dangerous. SARS-CoV-2 appears to infect both upper and lower airways. It spreads while still limited to the upper airways, before traveling into the deeper respiratory tract and leading to severe symptoms [15].\n",
            "SARS-CoV-2 attaches to a protein called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), on the surface of cells in the respiratory tract. As SARS-CoV-2 attacks the cells, dead cells flow down and block the airways with debris while the virus moves deeper into the lungs. Breathing becomes difficult because the lungs become clogged with dead cells and fluid. The immune system attacks the virus causing inflammation and fever. In severe cases, the immune system goes wild, causing more damage to the lungs than the actual virus. Blood vessels dilate to increase blood flow and become more permeable to maximize transport of chemical and cellular mediators the infection site. Inevitably, the lungs get filled with fluid. This exaggerated immune response is called cytokine storm and it leads to ARDS, fever, multiorgan failure, and death [15, 16].\n",
            "During cytokine storm, the immune system attacks indiscriminately without clearing the specific targets. Cytokine storm also affects other organs, especially if people already have chronic diseases [15]. The severity of cytokine storm determines who is hospitalized and who will be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The classification of COVID-19 is summarized in Table 1 [17].\n",
            "The morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 are due to excessive inflammatory cytokine production and immune hyperactivity. Alveolar macrophage activation and cytokine storm are the main pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. The pathological features include exudation and hemorrhage, epithelial injuries, infiltration of macrophages into the lungs, and fibrosis of lung tissue. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the activation of alveolar macrophage are characteristic abnormalities [18, 19]. Chemical and genetic studies have shown that the pulmonary endothelium is a key component of the cytokine storm. Therefore, modulation of the involved cellular signaling pathways may have therapeutic effects [20, 21].\n",
            "COVID-19 begins when SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as the entry receptor for infection [22]. This induces ACE2 downregulation and shedding. Loss of ACE2 from the endothelium causes dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system, and it enhances inflammation and vascular permeability. Shedding of ACE2 from the endothelium releases enzymatically active soluble ACE2 (sACE2), which is tightly linked to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production in cell culture [23].\n",
            "Multiple signaling pathways are activated during an immune response and cytokine storm. The P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7r) is major factor involved in activation of the cytokine storm and lung pathology in response to viruses [24, 25], infection, inflammation, hypoxia, or trauma [26]. P2X7r is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) gated, nonselective cation channel, allowing Ca2+ and Na+ influx and K+ efflux. Extracellular ATP plays a central role in apoptotic cell death [27], the induction of inflammation [28], and mitochondrial failure in monocytes [29]. P2X7r mediates ATP-induced cell death in different cells and it promotes assembly and release of proinflammatory interleukins (IL-1β and IL-18) from immune cells after exposure to lipopolysaccharide and ATP [27]. P2X7r is constitutively expressed in many cells, including respiratory epithelial cells and most immune cells like neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic, natural killer, B and T lymphocytes [27].\n",
            "Studies stratified COVID-19 patients as: (i) severe symptoms and ICU admission and (ii) mild and moderate symptoms requiring hospitalization but not ICU [17, 19]. The severe patients have significantly higher levels of plasma pro-inflammatory factors (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1A, TNF-α) [19] and (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) [18] than non-ICU patients, and they were likely in cytokine storm [17, 19]. These findings justify the use of IL-6 receptor antagonists [18, 19]; however, a therapy to reduce inflammation at multiple levels, such as LLLT, could be more successful in controlling the unbalanced immune response (Figure 1).\n",
            "LLLT is effective against cytokine storm and ARDS while promoting healing and tissue regeneration. Experimental and animal models of pulmonary disease and infection have revealed multiple cellular and molecular effects, which are both local and systemic. LLLT reduces inflammation without impairing lung function in acute lung injuries and is a promising therapeutic approach for lung inflammatory diseases such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [26].\n",
            "In murine models of acute inflammation of the airways and lungs, transcutaneous LLLT delivered over the trachea decreases pulmonary microvascular leakage [30, 31], IL-1b levels [26, 30], IL-6 [26, 32], MIP-2 mRNA expression [30], and intracellular ROS production [24]. LLLT produces anti-inflammatory effects on tracheal hyperactivity, and reduces neutrophil influx [26, 30, 32–34] by inhibiting COX-2-derived metabolites [33]. In ARDS, LLLT elevates cyclic adenosine monophosphate [32, 34], a signaling molecule that stimulates IL-10 and G-CSF expression and blocks TNF-a and MIP-1. LLLT also reduces TNF-a levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and alveolar macrophages [26, 31–34]. In hemorrhagic lesions of the lungs, LLLT significantly reduces the hemorrhagic index and myeloperoxidase activity, to levels comparable to Celecoxib [35].\n",
            "LLLT contributes to the resolution of inflammation by upregulating IL-10 and downregulating P2X7r. LLLT changes the profile of inflammatory cytokines and elevates IL-10 [26, 31, 36], known as human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, in the lung and abolishes lung inflammation via a reduction of inflammatory cytokines and mast cell degranulation [31]. LLLT decreases collagen deposition as well as the expression of the P2X7r [26].\n",
            "LLLT contributes to healing by promoting apoptosis of inflammatory cells while suppressing apoptotic pathways in lung tissue. In a model of acute lung injury, LLLT reduced DNA fragmentation and apoptotic pathways via increased B-cell-lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), the key regulator of the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis, in alveolar epithelial cells while promoting DNA fragmentation in inflammatory cells [37]. In pulmonary idiopathic fibrosis, LLLT inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen [38], attenuates airway remodeling by balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue, and inhibiting fibroblast secretion of the pro-fibrotic cytokines [36].\n",
            "LLLT provides synergy in combination with medical treatment. It has a synergic anti-inflammatory action over alveolar macrophages pretreated with N-acetyl cysteine, an effective oral medicine for coughs and some lung conditions [39]. The synergic effects of LLLT combined with conventional treatments were reported on over 1000 patients in Russian studies [9–11].\n",
            "Extended time on ventilators causes lung injury but LLLT minimizes this side effect. In experimental models of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), LLLT following VILI resulted in lower injury scores, decreased total cell count and neutrophil count in bronchoalveolar lavage, and reduced alveolar neutrophil infiltration. LLLT in an experimental model of VILI in rats demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effect via decreased lung injury scores and lower counts of neutrophils in alveolar, interstitial, and bronchial lavage [39] (Figure 2).\n",
            "Evidence from the literature supports the use of LLLT for the treatment of COVID-19.\n",
            "Based on this information, LLLT will accelerate recovery from COVID-19 and will get patients off ventilator support and out of the ICU more rapidly. This could significantly decompress our severely overburdened health care systems.\n",
            "Laser dose is the amount of energy delivered per second per cm2. The effect of laser therapy is related to the amount of laser energy per cm2. The Arndt-Schultz Law is considered the standard to describe the dose dependent effects of LLLT [42]. The minimum therapeutic dose for a bio-stimulatory effect for red and infrared laser is 0.01 J/cm2 while for ultraviolet, blue, green laser it is 0.001 J/cm2. LLLT has a noticeable biphasic dose response. The effective stimulation dose is 1 J/cm2 on the target tissue. Doses greater than 10 J/cm2 produces inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effects are used in conditions requiring inhibition and suppression [2].\n",

            "Precautions [42]\n",
            "Because of the high intensity of lasers and the absorption of its wavelengths by different parts of ocular system, there is a possibility of damage to the eyes. It is important to use protective glasses that can absorb the specific wavelength. Protective glasses for each wavelength are different; therefore, choose the protective goggles specified for each wavelength. Both therapists and clients should wear protective goggles [42].\n",
            "The analgesic effect of laser manifests earlier than its healing effect, and the patients feel better because of this, but the actual tissue damage has not yet healed. Patients feel relaxed and more energetic because the pain is gone. However, they must allow enough time for recovery [42].\n",
            "Fatigue is the most common symptom following LLLT. This is due to hormonal and metabolite changes after laser therapy that increase expression natural pain killers like endorphins and enkephalins. These metabolites induce relaxation and sleepiness [42].\n",
            "Very rarely, when the treated area is close to large blood vessels, a patient may experience a temporary drop in the blood pressure and orthostasis. This is due to vasodilatation and increased circulation to the limbs. To avoid dizziness, it is recommended that patients drink fluids before LLLT, and then wait for a few minutes before getting up from the supine position [42].\n",

            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is an ongoing global pandemic. Neutralizing the virus is the focus of a multi-pronged approach, including behavioral, medical, and basic research efforts around the world. Vaccine and therapeutic development are predominantly focused on the essential virus-encoded Spike, main protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins. These targets have well characterized functions and, particularly for Spike, evidence for neutralizing antibodies in con-valescent patient serum. The availability of high-resolution structures of these targets, some in complex with drug candidates or neutralizing antibodies, has yielded mechanistic insight into their function and provided a platform for structure-guided drug design1–6. However, expanding of the range of SARS-CoV-2 drug targets may accelerate therapeutic discovery and increase diversity of available drugs to mitigate against the potential evolution of drug-resistant viral strains7.\n",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes three putative ion channels (viroporins)8, E, 3a, and 8a9. Viroporins are generally believed to modify host membrane permeability to promote viral assembly and release, among other functions8,10. Many successful drugs targeting ion channels have been developed11 and targeting viroporins with small molecule inhibitors, in particular the influenza M2 proton channel, has demonstrated therapeutic success12–14.\n",
            "In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 3a channel15. The ORF3 genomic region contains coding sequence for multiple open reading frames and exhibits high diversity among coronaviruses compared to neighboring regions16. Notably, 3a is highly conserved within the Betacoronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus which includes SARS-CoV-1 and related bat coronaviruses that are thought to be the zoonotic source of human-infecting SARS coronaviruses (Fig. S1)17. SARS-CoV-1 3a has been reported to form an emodin-sensitive K+-permeable cation channel15,18 and has been implicated in inflammasome activation19 and both apoptotic20 and necrotic cell death21. In mouse models of SARSCoV-1 infection, genomic deletion of ORF3a reduced viral titer and morbidity9. SARS-CoV-1 3a has therefore been considered a potential target for therapeutics to treat SARS.\n",
            "3a has three predicted transmembrane helices followed by a cytosolic domain with multiple β-strands per protomer chain15. Each of its domains: N-terminal, Transmembrane, and C-terminal have been proposed to play roles in SARS biology and pathogenesis15,19. 3a has been shown to form dimers, tetramers, and potentially higher order oligomers of 31 kDa subunits15,21. No structural information exists for 3a proteins nor are there structures of close homologs that could be used to generate structural models, impeding both computational discovery and design of inhibitors as well as a mechanistic understanding of 3a function. To better understand the basis for 3a function, we have determined structures of dimeric and tetrameric SARSCoV-2 3a in lipid nanodiscs by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and characterized 3a channel activity in a reconstituted system. This could provide a framework for the design of drugs which target 3a and have the potential to serve as COVID-19 therapeutics.\n",
            "Full length SARS-CoV-2 3a was heterologously expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with a cleavable C-terminal GFP tag. Whole cell currents recorded from 3a-expressing cells were difficult to distinguish from control cells, likely because the majority of 3a protein is present in intracellular membranes. To better assess 3a channel function, we purified 3a in detergent, reconstituted it into phosphatidylcholine lipids, and recorded currents across excised patches pulled from proteoliposome blisters.\n",
            "3a-containing patches generated currents with modest outward rectification in symmetric [K+] (rectification index = 1.28±0.02, mean ±s.e.m. (n=5)), consistent with preferential sidedness of rectifying channels in the membrane after reconstitution (Fig. 1A,B). We evaluated selectivity of 3a for different cations by replacing the K+-containing bath solution with solutions containing Na+, NMDG+, or Ca2+. Solution exchange resulted in reversal potential shifts from 0.3±0.3 mV in K+ to −6.7±0.5 mV in Ca2+, −13.5±1.8 mV in Na+, and −31.0±1.1 mV in NMDG+ (Fig. 1A,C). These shifts correspond to the following permeability ratios (PX/PK+): Ca2+ (2.04±0.06) > K+ (1.0) > Na+ (0.59±0.04) > NMDG+ (0.29±0.01) (Fig. 1D). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 3a is a cation channel with modest selectivity for Ca2+ and K+ over Na+.\n",
            "In K+- and Na+- containing solutions, channels remained open for long durations with infrequent closures. In contrast, in Ca2+-containing solutions, channels exhibited “flickery” behavior with frequent transitions to closed or subconductance states (Fig. 1F). Contrary to previous studies of SARSCoV-1 3a in cells, SARS-CoV-2 3a activity was not inhibited by Ba2+(15) or by the small molecule emodin18 (Fig. S2F,G). Alkaline pH modestly increased channel activity (by 31 ± 2% at −80 mV in symmetric K+, Fig. S2H,I,J). Gating was not observed in response to acidic pH (Fig. S2J). After a variable amount of time (on the order of minutes), we observed an increase in “flickery” closures followed by loss of channel activity in each patch, perhaps as a result of channel inactivation (Fig. 1G). The basis for this loss of channel activity remains to be determined. Current reduction occurred in discrete steps of 30.0 ± 0.8 pA from which we estimate the single channel conductance of 3a to be 375 pS at −80 mV under bi-ionic conditions with K+ in the pipette and Na+ in the bath (Fig. 1E,G).\n",
            "Purification of 3a in detergent resulted in two species separable by gel filtration (Fig. S3). A majority of 3a runs at a position consistent with a dimer of 62 kDa (Fig. S3A) and 5–10% runs as a 124 kDa tetramer (Fig. S3D). A similar degree of tetramer formation was observed at low concentrations of 3a by florescence size-exclusion chromatography, indicative of a biochemically stable species rather than concentration-dependent nonspecific aggregation (Fig. S3E). These data are consistent with previous reports of dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-1 3a observed by western blot15,21.\n",
            "We separately reconstituted dimeric and tetrameric SARS-CoV-2 3a into nanodiscs made from the scaffold protein MSP1E3D1 and a mixture of POPC, DOPE, and POPS lipids and determined their structures by cryo-EM (Fig. 2A–H). We also determined the structure of dimeric 3a in the presence of 100 μM emodin, but observed no significant structural changes from dimeric apo 3a or any indication of bound emodin. This is consistent with the lack of emodin inhibition observed in proteoliposome recordings (Fig. S2F,J). The final dimeric reconstruction (with C2 symmetry applied) had an overall resolution of 2.9 Å and permitted de novo modeling of 195 of the 275 amino acids per protomer chain (Fig. 2B). The N-terminus (amino acids 1–39), C-terminus (amino acids 239–275), and a short cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 175–180) are either not observed or weakly resolved in the density map, presumably due to conformational differences between particles or because they are disordered.\n",
            "3a adopts a fold that is, to our knowledge, novel among available protein structures. Querying the protein structure database for structural homologs with DALI returned only weak hits for fragments of 3a domains22. Viewed from the membrane plane, 3a is approximately 70 Å tall with a 40 Å high transmembrane region and a cytosolic domain (CD) extending 30 Å out of the membrane (Fig. 2B). The transmembrane region is composed of three helices per protomer. The N-termini are oriented on the extracellular or lumenal side and C-termini on the cytosolic side of the bilayer. 3a is thus a Class IIIA viroporin according to the classification system of Nieva et al10. Viewed from the extracellular side, the transmembrane helices (TMs) trace the circumference of an ellipse with TM1–3 from one protomer followed by TM1–3 of the second protomer in a clockwise order (Fig. 2C). TM1s and TM2s pack against each other across the elliptical minor axis with TM3s positioned at the major axis vertices. TM1-TM2 and TM2-TM3 are joined by short intracellular and extracellular linkers, respectively. The transmembrane region connects to the CD through a turn-helix-turn motif following TM3. Each protomer chain forms a pair of opposing β-sheets packed against one another in an eight stranded β-sandwich (Fig. 2B,D). The outer sheet is formed by strands β1, β2, β6 and the N-terminal half of β7. The inner sheet is formed by strands β3, β4, β5, β8, and C-terminal half of β7. The inner sheets from each protomer interact through a large ( 940 Å2 of buried surface area per chain) and highly complementary interface with residues V168, V225, F230, and I232 forming a continuous buried hydrophobic core (Fig. 2D). The interaction between β-sandwiches from each protomer thus forms a strong and stable link between monomers in the dimer.\n",
            "Two-dimensional class averages of tetrameric 3a show a side by side arrangement of two dimers with well-separated TMs and close juxtaposition of CDs (Fig. 2F). Our tetrameric 3a reconstructions had lower final resolutions ( 6.5 Å) than dimeric 3a (Fig. 2F). However, the tetrameric map was sufficiently featured in the ICDs to enable rigid-body docking of two copies of the 3a dimer model (Fig. 2G). The best fit models show that TM3-CTD linkers and β1-β2 linkers from neighboring dimers form a continuous interface ( 300 Å2 buried surface area per dimer). While the exact positions of side chains cannot be determined at this resolution, residues W131, R134, K136, H150, T151, N152, C153, and D155 are poised to form a network of hydrophobic, polar, and electrostatic interactions which could mediate tetramerization (Fig. 2H).\n",
            "Tetramerization of SARS-CoV-1 3a observed by western blot was abolished by reducing agents and a C133A mutation resulted in the loss of tetramerization, membrane localization, and whole-cell currents15. However, expression of the C133A mutant was also dramatically reduced, so it may be that these results are a consequence of destabilizing 3a15. In SARS-CoV-2 3a, C133 is located in a notable cysteine-rich pocket adjacent to the tetramerization interface (Fig. S11A). At the base of TM3, C133 projects back towards the top faces of β1 and β2 in close proximity to solvent exposed C148 and buried C157. Due to geometric considerations, we modeled C133 and C157 as reduced sulfhydryls, but note that they are nearly within disulfide-bonding distance (Cα distance 6.9 Å) (Fig. S11A). While it is unlikely a single conserved disulfide mediates tetramerization in SARSCoV-1 3a and SARS-CoV-2 3a, it may be that disruption of this cysteine-rich pocket with cysteine modifying agents or mutations disfavor oligomerization in both channels.\n",
            "Analysis of possible conduction pathways through 3a reveals a narrow, bifurcated pore which stretches through the outer half of the TM region and is connected to a large and polar cavity open to the cytosol (Fig. 3). The pore has a series of six constrictions and narrows to 1 Å in radius, too small for the conduction of permeant cations. We therefore conclude this 3a structure represents either a closed or inactivated channel conformation.\n",
            "From the extracellular side, the first four constrictions are hydrophobic (Fig. 3A–F). Opposing F43 residues at the top of TM1 create two paths into the channel which taper to 1.5 Å in radius. The paths then merge and go through a series of tight ( 1Å radius) constrictions lined by L46 and I47, V50 and V58, and finally L53 and L85. The final two constrictions are polar (Fig. 3G,H). The close juxtaposition of Q57s from opposing TM1s splits the pore into two paths of 1 Å radius lined by C81s from TM2s. The final and widest constriction ( 2 Å radius) before the pore opens to the cavity is lined by S60, H78 and K61 from TM1 and H78 from TM2. Opening the channel would require conformational changes in TM1 and/or TM2 to both expand the hydrophobic constrictions and rearrange Q57 at the inner hydrophilic constriction.\n",
            "The polar cavity within the inner half of the TM region is continuous with the cytosol and surrounding bilayer through three pairs of openings: the upper, intersubunit, and lower tunnels (Fig. 3I–R). The upper tunnels are formed between TM2 and TM3 within each protomer and narrow to 2 Å in radius (Fig. 3J,K,L). Judging by the relative position of the nanodisc in the EM maps and hydrophobic character of the upper tunnel exterior, in a cell membrane they likely open to the surrounding lipid bilayer. The intersubunit tunnels run between TM1 and TM3 from different protomers, just above the CD, and narrow to 2.5 Å in radius (Fig. 3M,N,O). With a modest expansion, the intersubunit tunnels could permit even large cations like NMDG to access the channel cavity. The intersubunit tunnels open to the membrane-cytosol interface. Tubular shaped-densities are present in both the upper and intersubunit which are consistent with lipid acyl chains, but are not sufficiently featured to confidently model as such (Fig. S11B). The lower tunnels run underneath the TM1-TM2 linker and above the CD and narrow to 2 Å in radius (Fig. 3P,Q,R). The lower tunnels open well into the cytosol and are open paths for ion movement between the cell interior and channel cavity.\n",
            "The N-terminal 41 residues of each chain constitute the majority of the extracellularly or lumenally exposed 3a protein and thus could be involved in retention of 3a to internal membranes in cultured cells. To test this, we generated an N-terminal deletion construct lacking the first 41 amino acids (3aΔN) and compared its localization to wild-type 3a in HEK cells. Indeed, 3aΔN-EGFP shows reduced localization to internal membranes and bright foci and increased plasma membrane expression (Fig. 4A and Fig. S12). While we were unable to model the N-terminal 39 residues of 3a, an unassigned density feature in the cryo-EM maps that stretches between subunits just above the extracellular entrance to the pore that could correspond to a portion of these unmodeled N-terminal residues (Fig. 4B). We speculated that if the N-terminal region was stably positioned above the mouth of the pore it could influence channel properties. 3aΔN was therefore purified, reconstituted into proteoliposomes and compared to wild type 3a in patch recordings. Aside from a modest decrease in the relative permeability of Ca2+ to K+, no significant differences were observed in 3aΔN properties compared to wild-type 3a (Fig. 4C,D,E). These results are consistent with the N-terminal region of 3a being a determinant of its subcellular localization without influencing channel properties.\n",
            "Over forty thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced to date and analyses of mutations across time and geography have identified a large number of coding variants, some of which may have experienced selective pressure during viral evolution. To date, mutations that result in amino acid changes at 17 residues in 3a have been observed in different SARS-CoV-2 genomes23. Thirteen of these residues are represented with colored spheres overlaid on the 3a structure in Figure 5A (the remaining four positions: K16N/L, P36L, P240L/S/H, and P258L are unresolved in our structure). The most prevalent is a Q57H variant found in 25% of sequenced viruses, yet not observed in the earliest sequences or in related bat coronaviruses. Strikingly, as described above, Q57 forms the major hydrophilic constriction in the 3a pore (Fig. 3G and Fig. 5A). We asked whether this mutation had functional consequences by purifying 3a-Q57H, reconstituting it into proteoliposomes, and comparing channel activity to wild-type (Fig. 5B,C,D). No significant difference was observed in the expression, stability, conductance, selectivity, or gating behavior of 3a-Q57H (Fig. 5B,C,D and Fig. S13A,B,C) . We conclude that the presence of a histidine at this position does not influence channel properties. The remaining variants are much less common, being observed in <0.1% of sequenced viruses to date. Nine of these are unlikely to impact 3a structure or funcion as they are located in loops, lipid facing positions on TMs, and/or are conservative in nature (L41F/I/P, L53F, L96F/H, P104L/S/H, A110V/S, I123V, M125K/L/T, I232F/K/T and N234I/K). The remaining three are at the tetramerization interface (W131C/R/L, R134L/C/H, D155Y/H) (Fig. 2H, 5A). Whether these influence oligomerization or channel function remains to be determined.\n",
            "3a is very well conserved in the Betacoronavirus subgenus Sarbecovirus that includes SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S1). Structurally related proteins have not been identified in other coronaviruses (including the other five species known infect humans: MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43) by sequence homology. We asked whether we could identify more distant homologs using structure prediction algorithms and the SARS-CoV-2 3a structure. Coronaviridae are classified into 4 genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. 3a homologs were not detected in any Gammacoronavirus or Deltacoronavirus species or in the Betacoronavirus subgenus Embecovirus (which includes HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43). Distant homology to the CD was identified in the membrane protein ORF5 found in Betacoronavirus subgenus Merbecovirus species including MERS-CoV. In contrast, high confidence structural homologs were predicted in all remaining Betacoronavirus subgenera in proteins annotated ORF3 or NS3 and in all Alphacoronavirus subgenera in proteins annotated ORF3, NS3, ORF4, or NSP3B (including in HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 (Fig. S14)). Several of these homologs have been previously demonstrated to have ion channel activity24–26. Strikingly, all coronaviruses with 3a structural homologs are derived from the bat gene pool, while all those without 3a structural homologs derive from rodent, avian, or pig gene pools. This suggests coevolution of 3a with coronaviruses that have bats as their principal reservoir and may reflect a unique aspect of bat coronavirus biology. The true extent of 3a structural and functional conservation awaits further experimental confirmation. Still, this analysis suggests 3a or 3a-like proteins are more broadly present in coronaviruses than previously recognized and antiviral drugs targeting these proteins could potentially treat diseases associated with multiple known human coronavirus. Further experiments are that resolve the role of 3a in coronavirus biology and pathology could aid in the development of therapeutics targeting 3a channels.\n",
            "For preparation of the 3a dimer and mutant constructs, infected Sf9 cells from 1 L of culture ( 15–20 mL of cell pellet) were thawed in 100 mL of Lysis Buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 1mM EDTA pH 8. Protease inhibitors (Final Concentrations: E64 (1 μM), Pepstatin A (1 μg/mL), Soy Trypsin Inhibitor (10 μg/mL), Benzimidine (1 mM), Aprotinin (1 μg/mL), Leupeptin (1μg/mL), AEBSF (1mM), and PMSF (1mM)) were added to the lysis buffer immediately before use. Benzonase (4 μl) was added after the cell pellet thawed. Cells were then lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and residual nucleic acid was removed from the top of the membrane pellet using DPBS. Membrane pellets were scooped into a dounce homogenizer containing Extraction Buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace, Maumee, OH), pH 8). A 10% solution of DDM was dissolved and clarified by bath sonication in 200 mM Tris pH 8 prior to addition to buffer to the indicated final concentration. Membrane pellets were then homogenized in Extraction Buffer and this mixture (150 mL final volume) was gently stirred at 4°C for 1 hour. The extraction mixture was centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 45 minutes and the supernatant, containing solubilized membrane protein, was bound to 4 mL of Sepharose resin coupled to anti-GFP nanobody for 1 hour at 4°C. The resin was then collected in a column and washed with 10 mL of Buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% DDM, pH 7.4), 40 mL of Buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025% DDM, pH 7.4), and 10 mL of Buffer 1. The resin was then resuspended in 6 mL of Buffer 1 with 0.5 mg of PPX protease and rocked gently in the capped column for 2 hours. Cleaved 3a protein was then eluted with an additional 8 mL of Wash Buffer, spin concentrated to 500 μl with Amicon Ultra spin concentrator 10 kDa cutoff (Millipore), and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) on an NGC system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) equilibrated in Buffer 1. Peak fractions containing 3a channel were then collected and spin concentrated prior to incorporation into proteoliposomes or nanodiscs. For the tetramer, the preparation was carried out in a similar manner, except with overnight protease cleavage and collection of a peak of larger hydrodynamic radius (see Fig. S2).\n",
            "For proteoliposome patching experiments, we incorporated protein into lipid and generated proteoliposome blisters for patch recordings using dehydration and rehydration as described previously with the following modifications27. 3a dimer was first purified into Buffer 1. Protein was then exchanged into lipid with the addition of Biobeads SM2 and an overnight incubation at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:10 (corresponding to 0.5 mg purified 3a dimer and 5 mg of cleared Soybean L-α-phosphatidylcholine (Soy PC, MillaporeSigma, Burlington, MA) in DR Buffer (5 mM HEPES, 200 mM KCl, pH7.2).\n",
            "All electrophysiology recordings were made from 3a-reconstituted L-α-Phosphatidylcholine (Sigma P5638) proteoliposomes. Patches formed in an inside-out configuration and were quickly (within 5–10 seconds) transferred to a solution exchange chamber. Recordings were made at room temperature using Clampex 10.7 data acquisition software with an Axopatch 200B Patch Clamp amplifier and Digidata 1550B digitizer (Molecular Devices) at a bandwidth of 1 kHz and digitized at 500 kHz. A pressure clamp (ALA Scientific) was used to form seals. Potassium pipette and bath solution was 5 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2 . Sodium bath solution was 5 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2. NaCl in the bath solution was substituted for 150 mM NMDG-Cl or 75 mM CaCl2 for permeability experiments. Borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled and polished to a resistance of 2–5 MΩ when filled with pipette solution. For cation permeability experiments, liquid junction potentials were calculated and data were corrected offline. For current-voltage plots, the following voltage protocol was applied: Vhold= 0 mV mV; Vtest= −100 to +100 mV, Δ20 mV, ttest = 1 second. Currents from each patch correspond to mean values during the step to the indicated voltage.\n",
            "Permeability ratios were calculated according to Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz relationship. For monovalent cations, permeability ratios were calculated as PX+/PK+ = exp(ΔVrevF/RT). For divalent cations, permeability ratios were calculated as: PX2+/PK+=αK+K+expΔVrevF/RT1+expΔVrevF/RT/4αX2+X2+ Where Vrev is the reversal potential, F is Faraday’s constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T is absolute temperature (where RT/F = 25.2 mV at room temperature), and αis the ion activity coefficient (assumed to be 0.75 for K+ and 0.25 for Ca2+).\n",
            "Freshly purified 3a dimer in Buffer 1 was reconstituted into MSP1E3D1 nanodiscs with a mixture of lipids (DOPE:POPS:POPC at a 2:1:1 molar ratio, Avanti, Alabaster, Alabama) at a final molar ratio of 1:4:400 (Monomer Ratio: 3a, MSP1E3D1, lipid mixture). First, 20 mM solubilized lipid in Column Buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.4) was mixed with additional DDM detergent and 3a protein. This solution was mixed at 4°C for 30 minutes before addition of purified MSP1E3D1. This addition brought the final concentrations to approximately 15 μM 3a, 60 μM MSP1E3D1, 6 mM lipid mix, and 10 mM DDM in Column Buffer. The solution with MSP1E3D1 was mixed at 4°C for 10 minutes before addition of 200 mg of Biobeads SM2 (Bio-Rad). Biobeads (washed into methanol, water, and then Column Buffer) were weighed after liquid was removed by P1000 tip (damp weight). This mix was incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes before addition of another 200 mg of Biobeads (for a total 400 mg of Biobeads per 0.5 mL reaction). This final mixture was then gently tumbled at 4°C overnight ( 12 hours). Supernatant was cleared of beads by letting large beads settle and carefully removing liquid with a pipette. Sample was spun for 10 minutes at 21,000 × g before loading onto a Superdex 200 increase column in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.4. Peak fractions corresponding to 3a protein in MSP1E3D1 were collected, 10 kDa cutoff spin concentrated and used for grid preparation. MSP1E3D1 was prepared as described28 without cleavage of the His-tag. Tetrameric 3a in nanodiscs was prepared similarly, except with a ratio of 1:2:200 (Monomer Ratio: 3a, MSP1E3D1, lipid mixture).\n",
            "Dimeric 3a in MSP1E3D1 was prepared at final concentration of 1.1 mg/mL. For the sample with emodin (MillaporeSigma, Burlington, MA, Catalog E7881), a stock solution of 50 mM emodin in DMSO added to protein sample for final concentrations of 1.1 mg/mL 3a and 100 μM emodin and 1% DMSO. Concentrated sample was cleared by a 10 minute 21,000 × g spin at 4°C prior to grid making. For freezing grids, a 3 μl drop of protein was applied to freshly glow discharged Holey Carbon, 300 mesh R 1.2/1.3 gold grids (Quantifoil, Großlöbichau, Germany). A FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used with 4°C, 100% humidity, 1 blot force, a wait time of 5 seconds, and a 3 second blot time, before plunge freezing in liquid ethane. Grids were then clipped and used for data collection. Tetrameric 3a in MSP1E3D1 was frozen at 0.7 mg/mL with the same grid preparation.\n",
            "For the apo 3a dimer, motion-correction and dose-weighting were performed on all 6,309 movies using RELION 3.1’s implementation of MotionCor2, and 2x “binned” to 1.137 Å per pixel30–32. CTFFIND-4.1 was used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters33. Micrographs were then manually sorted to eliminate subjectively bad micrographs, such as empty or contaminated holes, resulting in 3,611 good micrographs. Additionally, micrographs with a CTF maximum resolution lower than 4 Å were discarded, resulting in 2,595 remaining micrographs. Template-free auto-picking of particles was performed with RELION3.1’s Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter yielding an initial set of particles. This initial set of particles were iteratively classified to generate templates, which were subsequently used to template-based auto-pick 1,750,730 particles.\n",
            "Template picked particles were iteratively 2D-classified in RELION3.1 and then in cryoSPARC v234, resulting in 820,543 particles. These particles were subsequently 3D-classified in cryoSPARC v2 with iterative ab-initio and heterogeneous refinement jobs. The resulting maps were visually evaluated with regard to the transmembrane domain density. A set of 86,479 particles were identified, polished in RELION3.1 and refined in cryoSPARC v2 with subsequent homogeneous and non-uniform refinement35 jobs (maps were low-pass filtered to an initial resolution where TM density was still visible (6–9 Å), and the dynamic mask was tightened with the near (2–5 Å) and far (3–9 Å) parameters), yielding a map with overall resolution of 3.6 Å.\n",
            "From this set of 86,479 particles, 2D-classification was performed in RELION3.1 to identify a set of particles with subjectively equal view distribution. From the resulting set, 1,000 particles were randomly sampled and their coordinates used for training in the Topaz particle-picking pipeline36. Training, picking, and extraction were performed independently on each subset of the micrographs. 4,134,279 total particles were extracted in RELION3.1 with a box size of 256 pixels and “binned” 4x to 4.548 Å/pixel. These particles were then iteratively 2D-classified in RELION3.1 resulting in 2,674,606 particles which were extracted at 2.274 Å/pixel. 2D-classification was continued in both RELION3.1 and cryoSPARC v2 resulting in 1,429,763 particles. Further classification was performed in cryoSPARC v2 with subsequent ab-initio (4 classes, max resolution 8 Å) and heterogeneous refinement (8 Å initial resolution) jobs. The two best classes were selected and the particles pooled resulting in 743,800 particles which were extracted in RELION3.1 at 1.137 Å/pixel.\n",
            "Iterative 3D-classification was performed with subsequent ab-initio and heterogeneous refinement jobs as described above. Following each round, 2D classification jobs were used to “rescue” good particles from the worst classes before the next round. After 3 rounds, a final 2D-classificaiton job was used to identify 112,502 particles, which were subsequently pooled with the previous 86,479 RELION3.1 template-picked particles, resulting in 185,871 particles after duplicates were removed.\n",
            "These particles were then refined with subsequent homogeneous and non-uniform refinement jobs resulting in a map with overall resolution of 3.4 Å. This map was post-processed in RELION3.1 using a mask with a soft edge (5 pixel extension, 7 pixel soft-edge), the output of which was used for Bayesian particle polishing in RELION3.1 (training and polishing were each performed independently on each subset of the micrographs). The resulting “shiny” particles were then refined in cryoSPARC v2 with subsequent homogenous refinement (1 extra pass, 7 Å initial resolution) and non-uniform refinement (C2, 1 extra pass, 9 Å initial resolution) to yield a map with 2.9 Å overall resolution.\n",
            "For 3a dimer with added 100 μM emodin, initial processing was similar to the dimer without added drug (see processing supplement). As with the apo 3a dimer, the critical steps included Topaz particle picking, particle clean-up with cryoSPARC v2 ab-initio and heterogeneous refinement, non-uniform refinement with tightened masking, and RELION3.1 Bayesian particle polishing. However, in contrast to the apo dataset, we observed a set of particles that were included in < 4 Å reconstructions that had discontinuous transmembrane domain density. Removal of these particles with RELION3.1 3D classification without angular sampling led to the best map from the emodin-added dataset. We did not see any evidence of bound emodin, but the 1% DMSO added with drug addition may have contributed to subtle map differences (Fig. S8,S9).\n",
            "For the 3a tetramer, the initial 7,092 micrographs were first cleaned using manual inspection and removal of images with < 4 Å CtfMaxResolution to obtain a set of 4,324 micrographs. Reference particles for Topaz particle picking were generated by first template picking in RELION3.1, followed by 2D classification in both RELION3.1 and cryoSPARC v2, and subsequent ab-initio in cryoSPARC v2. Particles from various views were then selected from iterative RELION3.1 2D classification to create a set of 6,843 particles. Using these coordinates for training, Topaz particle picking was then performed to generate a set of 1,282,913 initial particles. These particles were then cleaned using 2D classification in RELION3.1 and cryoSPARC v2, followed by rounds of cryoSPARC v2 ab-initio and RELION3.1 3D classification. A major hurdle for tetramer processing was obtaining a reconstruction where most particles were properly oriented in the same direction (i.e. CD domains on the same side of the nanodisc as seen in the 2D classes, see Fig. 2F). Substantial, cleanup by 3D-classification was needed to generate a correctly aligned reference map, but this map could then be used as a reference for refinements and classification for larger particle sets. Reconstructions with C1 or C2 symmetry looked similar (see Fig. S10), although no tetramer reconstruction went to high enough resolution to determine symmetry with certainty. Therefore, it is possible that either the tetramer is pseudosymmetric or that different particles have heterogeneous orientations between dimer pairs. For the tetramer, the highest resolution reconstruction came from cryoSPARC v2 non-uniform refinement with a tightened mask, which was subsequently used for dimer-docking and figure preparation.\n",

This case describes the clinical course and management of the first hospitalised case of COVID -19 in Maldives, a small island setting with limited medical resources.\n",
            "The patient, a 69-year-old male, had travelled to Maldives from Italy – this was a high risk country as designated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), the department leading the COVID -19 response in Maldives. The patient, who presented to the resort doctor within three days of arrival with a history of symptoms suggestive of COVID -19, was identified through the surveillance mechanism instituted as a core feature of the pandemic preparedness and response to COVID -19 in Maldives. He was assessed and taken to an isolation facility as a suspected case of COVID -19. He was tested for SARS-nCOV2 with RT-PCR assay returning a positive result, while tests were negative for Influenza A and B. At the time of detection, the patient had a fever for two days with no history of cough or shortness of breath, had no known comorbidities and was not on any medication. Physical examination recorded a temperature of 100.8 °F, and other vital signs normal. The case was then reported to the HPA.\n",
            "The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated with dyspnea, on day five of symptom onset, and was transported to the island of Male’ to the designated intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID -19, with the working diagnosis of COVID -19 with bilateral pneumonia. Lung auscultation showed crepitation in the interscapular and infrascapular regions on both lungs. A chest x-ray showed bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities more evident in both bases, consistent with the changes in respiratory status (Fig. 1\n",
            "). At this time, the treatment strategy was supportive and management was consistent with the interim guidance of World Health Organization on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected [1]. Over the first six days of ICU admission, despite increasing oxygenation, maintaining oxygen saturation was difficult and varied between 89 and 94% with oxygenation at 3 lit/min. The patient continued to have persistent fever and developed diarrhoea during this period. Computerised tomography (CT) of chest on day three of ICU admission showed bilateral, multifocal peripheral ground glass opacification and consolidation (Fig. 2\n",
            "), consistent with the patient's respiratory status. Case management included combination of antivirals Lopinavir, Ritonavir and Oseltamivir [2], and prophylactic treatment with a quinolone was started while awaiting results of culture sensitivity. The decision to start quinolone was based on the assumption of hospital acquired secondary infection, the most common of which are pseudomonas and klebsiella that are sensitive to quinolones in the hospital in which the patient was being treated. Complications emerged from day three of ICU admission and were managed with supportive treatment, including premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and electrolyte imbalances. The patient improved with the antiviral combination and supportive treatment protocol. With reported negative results for the second test, patient was discharged on day 15 of onset.\n",
            "For COVID -19 testing, clinical specimens (throat swabs and sputum) were tested with rRT-PCR assay with SarbecoV E-gene plus EAV control and Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP gene with reported sensitivity of 5.2 copies per reaction [95%] and 3.8 copies per reaction [95%] respectively. The initial specimen taken on day three of symptom onset was positive for 2019–nCoV. The cycle threshold value [Ct] was 25.664 E gene. A second assay was run with the Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP gene resulting positive with a Ct value of 26.9 gene indicating high levels of virus in these specimens. The same approach was used to ascertain recovery on day 14 of symptom onset and a repeat test was done 24 hours later as per the standard protocol for COVID -19 in Maldives. Serology on day 21 of symptom onset, was positive for IgM and IgG antibodies.\n",

The clinical findings are consistent with those reported in literature, with relatively late onset of dyspnea, on day five of symptom onset, anaemia, dyselectrolytema and cardiac injury [4,5]. The treatment protocol evolved during the course of the case management. A supportive treatment regimen with a combination of antivirals [6] and antibiotics resulted in rapid improvement clinically and a positive patient outcome. Oxygenation was managed with high flow nasal cannula with the target SpO2 of 94% [7] and was central to the clinical management. The observation of arrhythmias is likely associated with hypocalcemia [8]. During the illness, the patient also developed anemia, which has been reported in some of the more severe COVID-19 cases [9]. In this case, the anemia improved with clinical improvement, without any specific intervention. However, given the high prevalence of thalassemia carriers among the population (16%–18%) [10], management of anemia will need careful consideration among local patients.\n",

The case was, classified as an imported case of COVID -19 to Maldives. In conclusion, the clinical and biochemical findings of the imported severe case of COVID -19 in Maldives is consistent with other reported findings in the literature. Prompt oxygenation and supportive management proved effective in producing positive clinical outcomes. The surveillance and active case finding measures instituted in the country allowed for early diagnosis that allowed timely treatment and recovery of the case.\n",

            "The infection of avian populations with certain subtypes of avian influenza A virus poses a continuous global human public health risk of a sporadic human zoonotic infection and emergence of a pandemic influenza strain. Human infection with one of these novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses was first recognized during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong S.A.R. of China. Since 2003, outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N1) have occurred among poultry in Asia, Europe and Africa, and human infections with this subtype are continuing [1]. The consequences have worsened with 382 infected human cases and 241 deaths as of April, 2008 [2]. Millions of avian species have been lost by culling, imposing a huge economical burden on developing countries.\n",
            "The ongoing circulation of avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in areas of Asia and Africa and the continued human infection with this subtype emphasize the need to enforce a diagnostic protocol for rapid and sensitive detection of the infections. Several methods have been used for A(H5N1) diagnosis in reference laboratories including PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR, especially a conventional RT-PCR method using specific primers as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3].\n",
            "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method reported by Notomi et al. in 2000 [4, 5] with the advantage of being simple, rapid and easy to perform especially in the field setting where there is a lack of sophisticated diagnostic equipment.

In addition, our primers may be applicable for all the clades and subclades of A(H5N1) influenza viruses based on the lower number of mismatches to the reference sequences. Experimental results with nine A(H5N1) virus strains of both clade 1 and 2 (subclade 2.3) and the clinical samples collected in 2007 in Vietnam showed high specificity and sensitivity.

Ltd.; Tochigi, Japan) containing 40 pmol each of FIP and BIP primers, 20 pmol each of loop-primers, 5 pmol each of F3 and B3 outer primers, 1.4 mM concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.8 M betadine, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase (New England Bolabs), 0.625 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 5µl of extracted RNA. The reaction mix was incubated at 62.5°C for 90 minutes in Loopamp realtime turbidimeter LA-200 (Teramecs, Japan). Positive and negative controls were included in each run, and all precautions to prevent cross-contamination were observed.\n",
            "To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the H5 RT-LAMP assay, conventional RTPCR was also performed with the primer set designed by the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory Network [12]. The sequences of these primers were 5'-GCCATTCCACAACATACACCC-3' (H5-1) and 5'-CTCCCCTGCTCATTGCTATG-3' (H5-3). 5µl of RNA solution was added as the template to 45µl of master mixture using Qiagen Onestep RT-PCR kit. Procedures were followed as described in the WHO protocol [12].\n",
            "According to the A(H5N1) diagnostic protocol in the Department of Virology, National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), Hanoi, Vietnam, real-time RT-PCR assay was used to confirm cases which showed unclear positive results using the conventional RT-PCR. The primer/probe sequences and procedure are described in the WHO protocol [12].\n",
            "To evaluate the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay with our H5 primer set, all the nine A(H5N1) virus strains with known plaque-forming unit (PFU) titers were serially diluted 10-fold until 10−6 PFU and tested. At the same time, two RT-LAMP assays using NIID primers and our H5 primers and a conventional RT-PCR using H5 WHO primer were carried out for each virus strain to compare the sensitivity. The sensitivity of our RT-LAMP primers compared with the RT-PCR were the same (for seven strains) or 10 times lower (for two strains). On the other hand, compared with the NIID RT-LAMP primer set, the sensitivity of our RT-LAMP assay was 10 to 100 times higher (for four strains) or the same (for five strains) (Table 2). Our H5 RT-LAMP primers could detect the viruses at the concentration of 1 PFU per reaction within 20 minutes, and all of the positive samples showed positivity within 60 minutes (Figure 1).\n",
            "The specificity of the H5 RT-LAMP tests was checked by examining H5 viruses and other respiratory viruses including seasonal human influenza H3N2 and H1N1 (data not shown). All the positive samples were H5 virus strains, and this was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (3%, ethidium bromide staining). The H5 samples showed very clear ladder-like patterns on the gel, while no positive amplification was observed in other viruses.\n",
            "A total of 41 clinical samples of H5 suspected patients collected in Northern Vietnam in 2007 were examined. All of the samples were tested both by our RT-LAMP and by WHO RT-PCR. Some with unclear results were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. The data showed identical positive results between RT-LAMP and RT-PCR in 16 of 41 samples. Twenty four samples gave negative results by both methods. Only one sample, which was negative with RT-LAMP, gave an unclear positive (+/−) result with RT-PCR, but was confirmed as positive by real-time RT-PCR (Table 3). All the positive samples by RT-LAMP showed the ladder-like pattern in electrophoresis analysis.\n",
            "Furthermore, we have tested 30 recently collected human and avian samples, which are the suspected and confirmed cases of A(H5N1) in Northern Vietnam between late 2007 and March 2008 (data not shown). 100% of the positive cases with RT-PCR had been detected by RT-LAMP and there was no false positive result. Notably, the positive samples whose detection time was around 20 minutes could be propagated in cell culture.\n",
            "The efficient transmission of A(H5N1) influenza viruses among humans, which is an essential prerequisite for a pandemic, has not been reported. However, human cases transmitted by close contact with infected poultry have been reported continuously. An early and rapid method for diagnosis of A(H5N1) human suspected cases has an important role in the surveillance of the disease.\n",
            "LAMP has been shown to be a useful nucleic acid amplification method for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of diseases due to its simple operation, rapid reaction and easy detection. An RT-LAMP assay is a simple diagnosis tool in which the reaction is carried out in a single tube by mixing the buffer, primers, reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase and incubating the mixture at 62.5°C for 60 minutes in a regular laboratory water bath or heat block. The results can be detected by naked-eye observation. However, applying the RT-LAMP method to A(H5N1) influenza virus identification faces difficulties such as the rapid genetic changes of the virus. Because the RT-LAMP primer set consists of six primers that recognize eight distinct regions on the target gene, new strains of A(H5N1) virus with a number of mismatches may emerge easily. This could be the reason why the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay is not consistant among the strains of A(H5N1) virus. Hence, the sequences of the primers should be updated frequently.\n",
            "In this study, we designed a new RT-LAMP primer set to detect the H5 HA gene of HPAI viruses. The experimental results for nine Vietnamese strains of A(H5N1) influenza viruses showed a comparable sensitivity to that of the WHO recommended RT-PCR assay (the sensitivity was the same in seven strains, while the other two were 10 times lower) and a little higher than the previously published H5 RT-LAMP primer set. These data (with clade 1 and 2.3 of H5 viruses) and the alignment showing the very limited number of mismatches with clade 2.1 and 2.2 (Table 4) suggest that our LAMP primers can be used widely and effectively with all circulating A(H5N1) viruses.\n",
            "The detection limits of H5 RT-LAMP vary from 1 PFU to 10−3 PFU for each virus strain (Table 2). Although PFU titer indicates a functional measurement rather than a quantitive method, higher detection limits of 0.1 or 1 PFU were obtained, and almost all of the viruses were 2007 isolates, which have re-emerged since November 2005. Two strains that showed lower sensitivity by our RT-LAMP method also belonged to that group. This suggests that the genotypes of circulating A(H5N1) influenza viruses have changed and that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was reduced even though the assay has been updated this time. Analysis of genetic changes in A(H5N1) viruses and continuous upgrading of the primers may be needed in the near future. Current examinations on human and avian clinical samples in Northern Vietnam from late 2007 until March 2008 showed that our RT-LAMP primers had high sensitivity and specificity to those strains compared to RT-PCR and viral isolation. The evolution analysis of updated A(H5N1) viruses has characterized Vietnam’s strains belonging to subclade 2.3.4 [13], and the sequence alignment of these strains shows that the target region for our RT-LAMP is still well conserved. Thus we predict that our primers will work well on new A(H5N1) viruses from Vietnam.\n",
            "In conclusion, a new set of RT-LAMP primers for H5 HA gene detection was developed and tested. The sensitivity and specificity of our RT-LAMP primer set compared with another RT-LAMP primer set and the conventional RT-PCR demonstrates the potential of this method for use in the diagnosis and surveillance of H5 suspected human cases, especially in the field.\n",
            "This paper is in response to the article “Designing for 21st century learning online: a heuristic method to enable educator learning support roles” (Nacu et al. 2018). In this paper, the authors outline a framework for heuristic evaluation when designing online experiences to support twenty-first century learning.\n",
            "Twenty-first century skills can be key to success in a modern knowledge society. Among these skills, critical thinking is important not only at work, where problem solving is essential, but also in any social setting where adequate decision making is required (Dwyer and Walsh 2020). Additionally, creativity helps ensure that the outcomes of critical thinking can be both culturally ingenious as well as treasured (Yeh et al. 2019b). This is achieved by embracing cognitive abilities in order to create new combinations of ideas (Davis 1969).\n",
            "Technology has been shown to facilitate the development of higher-order thinking skills in learning (Engerman et al. 2018). However, in general, schools have failed to take advantage of this by incorporating adequate use of technology into their practices (Olszewski and Crompton 2020). Therefore, the rush towards online learning by education systems during COVID-19 can also be seen as an opportunity to develop students’ higher-order thinking skills. One potential drawback with online learning is the distance it creates between peers, thus hindering student engagement and the development of higher-order thinking skills (Dwyer and Walsh 2020). We show how this barrier can be overcome when developing critical thinking and creativity in an online context.\n",
            "Critical thinking includes the ability to identify the main elements and assumptions of an argument and the relationships between them, as well as drawing conclusions based on the information that is available, evaluating evidence, and self-correcting, among others. It is seen as a self-regulated process that comes from developing skills such as interpretation, analysis, evaluation and explanation; going beyond technical skills. It can therefore be considered a metacognitive process (Saxton et al. 2012; Facione 1990).\n",
            "By taking learning online, both self-study and teacher-led sessions can be enhanced through a problem-based learning strategy. In the first stage, students build on a question or topic posed by the teacher, e.g. a mathematical problem or an essay writing assignment. In the second stage, students peer-review their classmates’ responses or essays using a rubric provided by the teacher. Students break down their classmates’ responses and see how they relate to the objective of the activity. They then compare this analysis with the rubric in order to provide feedback. In a third stage, the students develop a new response based on their initial response, the experience of giving feedback, and the feedback they received. This process develops self-evaluation as the students compare their own response with their classmates’ and discover any gaps in their knowledge. It can also develop metacognition as they integrate various sources of knowledge (initial response, feedback received and the experience of giving feedback) when developing a new response. In the final stage, the teacher discusses the different responses with the class. The teacher then compares the students’ work with the expected response and provides a general summary, transferring the responses to different domains.\n",
            "While Stages 1 through 3 are asynchronous and computer-aided, stage 4 can be synchronous and supported by the use of a web-based video conferencing tool. Active student participation and teacher mediation are both key since interactive and instant feedback has been shown to improve critical thinking (Chang et al. 2020).\n",
            "In addition to the problem-based strategy presented here, other active learning strategies can also be used to develop critical thinking, e.g. structured questioning, role playing, and cooperative learning (Cruz and Dominguez 2020). How these might be implemented online is still open to discussion, though heuristic evaluations may be a good alternative given the possibilities presented by online learning as a resource provider, learning broker and learning promoter (Nacu et al. 2018).\n",
            "Creativity is an essential element of the problem-solving process. Creative people often find ways of addressing a problem that others cannot see, while also having the ability to overcome barriers where others may otherwise give up (Kaufman 2016). There are different techniques for developing creativity. In-depth learning is facilitated when students represent concepts based on their own personal perceptions (Liu et al. 2018). In this sense, analogy can be a powerful tool for boosting creativity. Analogical transfer includes the idea of making analogies by analyzing objects, ideas or concepts across domains, i.e. information is transferred from the known (the original domain) to the unknown (the new domain) by searching for similarities (Shen and Lai 2014).\n",
            "We propose an analogical transfer strategy. In the first stage, the teacher identifies a concept with examples from different domains. This might include showing a video that not only introduces the concept but also provides a context that is both familiar and relatable for the students. In the second stage, students reflect on situations from their own lives where they can apply the concept that is being studied. Here, the use of open-ended questions allows the students’ creativity to be explored in greater depth, while adapting to their different backgrounds and levels of prior knowledge. In the third stage, which is mediated by the teacher, the students discuss their responses from stage 2. The teacher should focus on original responses from different domains, or responses where it is not clear whether the solution is correct.\n",
            "Stages 1 and 2 can be conducted asynchronously and scaffolded using technology through the inclusion of multimedia and student guides. However, stage 3 should be synchronous and supported by the use of a web-based video conferencing tool. In this way, technology facilitates the development of creativity by facilitating the discovery process, the collection of ideas, and the integration of knowledge (Yang et al. 2018). Mediation in stage 3 is therefore key (Giacumo and Savenye 2020). Effective teacher-student dialogue can improve the teacher-student relationship and enhance the creative process. Heuristic evaluation can therefore help us understand this relationship by looking at these interactions on the online platform (Nacu et al. 2018).\n",
            "As with any learning process, critical thinking and creativity require students to be both present and focused, which in turn requires grit (Yeh et al. 2019a). In other words, the way in which students approach their schooling is just as important as what and how we teach them (Tissenbaum 2020). Grit should therefore not only be considered an essential element of academic achievement but also as a mental process that activates and/or directs people’s behavior and actions (Datu et al. 2018, Lan and Moscardino 2019). This is particularly relevant in a COVID-19 context, where the pandemic is affecting the wellbeing and mental health of many students, families & communities (OECD 2020).\n",
            "In order to achieve effective student engagement, the objective must be attainable, interesting and accessible (i.e. in their zone of proximal development). The means used to complete the task must be attractive and feel more like a reward than an assignment. Finally, the teacher should work on the students’ persistence, not just in order to complete the task but as an essential quality for everyday life (Barnes 2019).\n",
            "Teacher grit may also be key. As Haderer (2020) suggests “Why do some teachers stay when others run from the challenges?” In this sense, reflection has been shown to be relevant for teacher efficacy and grit (Haderer 2020). Heuristic evaluation methods may therefore allow the educator to understand the learning system as a whole (Nacu et al. 2018).\n",
            "As indicated in (Nacu et al. 2018) we are “faced with the need to create youth-centered spaces that also provide adult facilitation of learning”. Heuristic evaluation can therefore help connect online platforms with students, teachers and twenty-first century skills needs.\n",

that the sensitivity of the rt-lamp method was reduced even though the assay has been updated this time.', 'analysis of genetic changes in a h5n1 viruses and continuous upgrading of the primers may be needed in the near future.', 'current examinations on human and avian clinical samples in northern vietnam from late 2007 until march 2008 showed that our rt-lamp primers had high sensitivity and
